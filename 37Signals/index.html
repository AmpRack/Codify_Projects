					<h3>Useful is forever</h3>
					<h4>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.</h4>
				<h2>2</h2>
					<h3>Great service is everything</h3>
					<h4>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.</h4>
				<h2>3</h2>
					<h3>Clarity is king</h3>
					<h4>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.</h4>
				<h2>4</h2>
					<h3>Our customers are our investors</h3>
					<h4>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.</h4>
			</div>
			<div id="sec3_right">
				<h2>5</h2>
					<h3>The basics are beautiful</h3>
					<h4>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.</h4>
				<h2>6</h2>
					<h3>No hidden fees or secret prices</h3>
					<h4>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.</h4>
				<h2>7</h2>
					<h3>Software should be easy</h3>
					<h4>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, no hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.</h4>
				<h2>8</h2>
					<h3>Long-term contracts are obscene</h3>
					<h4>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</h4>
